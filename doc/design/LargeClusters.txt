Considerations for large clusters
=================================

Discovery
---------



ConcurrentHashMap
-----------------

CCHMs have a default initial capacity (16), load factor (0.75) and concurrency level (16). These are OK for most
scenarios, but we have to investigate whether these values are sufficient for 1000 node clusters.

When for example 1000 threads from different senders access the same CCHM, we need to make sure we don't have high
contention, ie. by spreading a 1000 senders over 16 buckets.

Investigate whether we should add CCHM initial sizes, load factors and concurrency levels as properties.

With ergonomics [1], we could for example set bucket sizes for CCHMs dynamically, e.g. based on cluster size.

Misc
----

- MERGE2: num_initial_members in Discovery should be large, so that we detect partitions sooner
