Loopback adaptor issues on Windows
----------------------------------

JIRA: http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-79

On Windows, when a loopback adaptor is created, we can associate multiple (virtual) IP
addresses with it, e.g. 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2.

However, when we have a member M1 bound to 10.0.0.1, and another member M2 bound to 10.0.0.2, and
bind_to_all_interfaces is set to true, then it was observed that - regardless of the bind address -
the sender's address in a DatagramPacket received was always 10.0.0.1 (the first address assigned)!

Therefore, members would never find each other.

The reason this shows up now (in 2.2.8) is that as an optimization, we *don't* send the src address
in the Message anymore, so we can save a few bytes, but we null the src address, and set it to the sender's
address when we *receive* the packet.
This can be disabled by setting null_src_addresses to false (default is true)
