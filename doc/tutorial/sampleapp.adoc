== Writing a simple application
The goal of this chapter is to write a simple text-based chat application (SimpleChat), with the following features:

* All instances of SimpleChat find each other and form a cluster.
* There is no need to run a central chat server to which instances have to connect. Therefore, there is no
  single point of failure.
* A chat message is sent to all instances of the cluster.
* An instance gets a notification callback when another instance leaves (or crashes) and when other
  instances join.
* (Optional) We maintain a common cluster-wide shared state, e.g. the chat history. New instances acquire
  that history from existing instances.
    

=== JGroups overview
JGroups uses a `JChannel` as the main API to connect to a cluster, send and receive messages, and to register
listeners that are called when things (such as member joins) happen.

What is sent around are `Messages`, which contain a byte buffer (the payload), plus the sender's and receiver's address.
Addresses are subclasses of `org.jgroups.Address`, and usually contain an IP address plus a port.

The list of instances in a cluster is called a `View`, and every instance contains
exactly the same view. The list of the addresses of all instances can get retrieved by calling
View.getMembers().

Instances can only send or receive messages after they've joined a cluster.

When an instance wants to leave the cluster, methods `JChannel.disconnect()` or `JChannel.close()` can be called.
The latter actually calls `disconnect()` if the channel is still connected before closing the channel.

=== Creating a channel and joining a cluster
To join a cluster, we'll use a JChannel. An instance of JChannel is created with a configuration
(e.g. an XML file) which defines the properties of the channel. To actually connect to the cluster, the
`connect(String clustername)` method is used. All channel instances which call connect() with the same argument will
join the same cluster. So, let's actually create a JChannel and connect to a cluster called "ChatCluster":
        
[source,java]
----
import org.jgroups.JChannel;

public class SimpleChat {
    JChannel channel;
    String user_name=System.getProperty("user.name", "n/a");

    private void start() throws Exception {
        channel=new JChannel(); // use the default config, udp.xml
        channel.connect("ChatCluster");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        new SimpleChat().start();
    }
}
----


First we create a channel using the empty constructor. This configures the channel with the default properties.
Alternatively, we could pass an XML file to configure the channel, e.g. `new JChannel("/home/bela/udp.xml")`.

The `connect()` method joins cluster "ChatCluster". Note that we don't need to explicitly create a cluster
beforehand; connect() creates the cluster if it is the first instance. All instances which join the same
cluster will be in the same cluster, for example if we have
            
* ch1 joining "cluster-one"
* ch2 joining "cluster-two"
* ch3 joining "cluster-two"
* ch4 joining "cluster-one"
* ch5 joining "cluster-three"

, then we will have 3 clusters: "cluster-one" with instances ch1 and ch4, "cluster-two" with ch2 and ch3,
and "cluster-three" with only ch5.
        

=== The main event loop and sending chat messages
We now run an event loop, which reads input from stdin ('a message') and sends it to all
instances currently in the cluster. When "exit" or "quit" are entered, we fall out of the
loop and close the channel.


[source,java]
----
private void start() throws Exception {
    channel=new JChannel();
    channel.connect("ChatCluster");
    eventLoop();
    channel.close();
}

private void eventLoop() {
    BufferedReader in=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    while(true) {
        try {
            System.out.print("> "); System.out.flush();
            String line=in.readLine().toLowerCase();
            if(line.startsWith("quit") || line.startsWith("exit"))
                break;
            line="[" + user_name + "] " + line;
            Message msg=new Message(null, line);
            channel.send(msg);
        }
        catch(Exception e) {
        }
    }
}
----

We added the call to eventLoop() and the closing of the channel to the start() method, and we provided an
implementation of eventLoop.

The event loop blocks until a new line is ready (from standard input), then sends a message to the cluster.
This is done by creating a new Message and calling Channel.send() with it as argument.

The first argument of the Message constructor is the destination address. A null destination address
sends the message to everyone in the cluster (a non-null address of an instance would send the message
to only one instance).
        

The second argument is the line that we read from stdin, this uses Java
serialization to create a byte[] buffer and set the message's payload. Note that we could also
serialize the object ourselves (which is actually recommended!) and use the Message contructor which
takes a byte[] buffer as second argument.

The application is now fully functional, except that we don't yet receive messages or view notifications.
This is done in the next section below.
        

=== Receiving messages and view change notifications

Let's now register as a `Receiver` to receive message and view changes. To this end, we could implement
`org.jgroups.Receiver`, however, I chose to extend `ReceiverAdapter` which has default
implementations, and only override callbacks (`receive()` and `viewChange()`) we're interested in. We
now need to extend ReceiverAdapter:


[source,java]
----
public class SimpleChat extends ReceiverAdapter {
----
, set the receiver in `start()`:
        

[source,java]
----
private void start() throws Exception {
    channel=new JChannel().setReceiver(this);
    channel.connect("ChatCluster");
    eventLoop();
    channel.close();
}
----
, and implement `receive()` and `viewAccepted()`:
        
[source,java]
----
public void viewAccepted(View new_view) {
    System.out.println("** view: " + new_view);
}

public void receive(Message msg) {
    System.out.println(msg.getSrc() + ": " + msg.getObject());
}
----

The viewAccepted() callback is called whenever a new instance joins the cluster, or an existing instance
leaves (crashes included). Its toString() method prints out the view ID (an increasing ID) and a list of
the current instances in the cluster

In receive(), we get a Message as argument. We simply get its buffer as an object (again using Java
serialization) and print it to stdout. We also print the sender's address (Message.getSrc()).

Note that we could also get the byte[] buffer (the payload) by calling Message.getBuffer() and then
de-serializing it ourselves, e.g. String line=new String(msg.getBuffer()).
        



=== Trying out the SimpleChat application
Now that the demo chat application is fully functional, let's try it out. Start an instance of SimpleChat:
            
....
[linux]/home/bela$ java SimpleChat

-------------------------------------------------------------------
GMS: address=linux-48776, cluster=ChatCluster, physical address=192.168.1.5:42442
-------------------------------------------------------------------
** view: [linux-48776|0] [linux-48776]
>
....

The name of this instance is `linux-48776` and the physical address is `192.168.1.5:42442` (IP address:port).
A name is generated by JGroups (using the hostname and a random short) if the user doesn't set it. The name
stays with an instance for its lifetime, and maps to an underlying UUID. The UUID then maps to a
physical address.
        
We started the first instance, let's start the second instance:
        

[listing]
....
[linux]/home/bela$ java SimpleChat

-------------------------------------------------------------------
GMS: address=linux-37238, cluster=ChatCluster, physical address=192.168.1.5:40710
-------------------------------------------------------------------
** view: [linux-48776|1] [linux-48776, linux-37238]
>
....

The cluster list is now `[linux-48776, linux-37238]`, showing the first and second instance that
joined the cluster. Note that the first instance (`linux-48776`) also received the same view, so both
instances have the exact same view with the same ordering of its instances in the list. The instances are
listed in order of joining the cluster, with the oldest instance as first element.

Sending messages is now as simple as typing a message after the prompt and pressing return. The message will
be sent to the cluster and therefore it will be received by both instances, including the sender.

When "exit" or "quit" is entered, then the instance will leave the cluster. This means, a new
view will be installed immediately.

To simulate a crash, simply kill an instance (e.g. via CTRL-C, or from the process manager). The other
surviving instance will receive a new view, with only 1 instance (itself) and excluding the crashed
instance.


=== Extra credits: maintaining shared cluster state
One of the use cases of JGroups is to maintain state that is replicated across a cluster. For example, state
could be all the HTTP sessions in a web server. If those sessions are replicated across a cluster, then
clients can access any server in the cluster after a server which hosted the client's session crashed,
and the user sessions will still be available.

Any update to a session is replicated across the cluster, e.g. by serializing the attribute that was
modified and sending the modification to every server in the cluster via `JChannel.send()`. This is needed
so that all servers have the same state.

However, what happens when a new server is started ? That server has to somehow get the state
(e.g. all HTTP sessions) from an existing server in the cluster.
This is called _state transfer_.

State transfer in JGroups is done by implementing 2 (getState() and setState()) callbacks and
calling the JChannel.getState() method.
Note that, in order to be able to use state transfer in an application, the protocol stack has
to have a state transfer protocol (the default stack used by the demo app does).

The start() method is now modified to include the call to JChannel.getState():


[source,java]
----
private void start() throws Exception {
    channel=new JChannel().setReceiver(this);
    channel.connect("ChatCluster");
    channel.getState(null, 10000);
    eventLoop();
    channel.close();
}
----

The getState() method's first argument is the target instance, and null means get the state from the first
instance (the coordinator). The second argument is the timeout; here's we're willing to wait for 10 secs
to transfer the state. If the state cannot be transferred within this time, then an exception will be
thrown. 0 means wait forever.

ReceiverAdapter defines a callback getState() which is called on an existing instance
(usually the coordinator) to fetch the cluster state. In our demo application, we define the state to be
the chat conversation. This is a simple list, to the tail of which we add every message we receive.
(Note that this is probably not the best example for state, as this state always grows. As a workaround,
we could have a bounded list, which is not done here though).

The list is defined as an instance variable:
        
[source,java]
----
final List<String> state=new LinkedList<String>();
----

Of course, now we need to modify receive() to add each received message to our state:
        

[source,java]
----
public void receive(Message msg) {
    String line=msg.getSrc() + ": " + msg.getObject();
    System.out.println(line);
    synchronized(state) {
        state.add(line);
    }
}
----

The getState() callback implementation is
        

[source,java]
----
public void getState(OutputStream output) throws Exception {
    synchronized(state) {
        Util.objectToStream(state, new DataOutputStream(output));
    }
}
----

The getState() method is called in the _state provider_, ie. an existing instance, to
return the shared cluster state. It is passed an output stream to which the state has to be written. Note
that JGroups closes that stream automatically after the state has been written, even in the case of an
exception, so the stream doesn't need to be closed.

Since access to +state+ may be concurrent, we synchronize it. Then we call Util.objectToStream()
which is a JGroups utility method writing an object to an output stream.
        
The setState() method is called on the _state requester_, ie. the instance
which called JChannel.getState(). Its task is to read the state from the input stream and set it
accordingly:
        

[source,java]
----
public void setState(InputStream input) throws Exception {
    List<String> list;
    list=(List<String>)Util.objectFromStream(new DataInputStream(input));
    synchronized(state) {
        state.clear();
        state.addAll(list);
    }
    System.out.println(list.size() + " messages in chat history):");
    list.forEach(System.out::println);
}
----

We again call a JGroups utility method (Util.objectFromStream()) to create an object from an input stream.

Then we synchronize on +state+, and set its contents from the received state.

We also print the number of messages in the received chat history to stdout. Note that this is not
feasible with a large chat history, but - again - we could have a bounded chat history list.
        

=== Conclusion
In this tutorial, we showed how to create a channel, join and leave a cluster, send and receive messages,
get notified of view changes and implement state transfer. This is the core functionality provided by
JGroups through the +JChannel+ and +Receiver+ APIs.
        
JGroups has two more areas that weren't covered: building blocks and the protocol stack.

Building blocks are classes residing on top of a JChannel that provide a higher abstraction level, e.g.
request-response correlators, cluster-wide method calls, replicated hashmaps and so forth.
        
The protocol stack allows for complete customization of JGroups: protocols can be configured, removed,
replaced, enhanced, or new protocols can be written and added to the stack.
